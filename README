Geo/Distance version 0.11
=========================

This perl library aims to provide as many tools to make it as simple as possible to calculate 
distances between geographic points, and anything that can be derived from that.  Currently 
there is support for finding the closest locations within a specified distance, to find the 
closest number of points to a specified point, and to do basic point-to-point distance 
calculations.
