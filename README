Geo/Distance version 0.02
=========================

This perl library provides the ability to calculate the distance 
between two geographic points.  There is both a function oriented 
interface, and an object oriented interface.  Both have the same 
capabilities.  Your choice of interface depends on your programming 
style and needs.  Geo::Distance only recognizes standard decimal 
based longitude and latitude measurements.  If you have other 
coordinate systems that you would like to use, then take a peak at 
the Geo::Coordinates wrapper module.  The distance that is returned 
can be in one of several different measurements, such as meters, 
light seconds, miles, inches, feet, etc.
