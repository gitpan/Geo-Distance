Geo/Distance version 0.05
=========================

This version is far superior to any previous.  Lots of feature 
and effeciency enhancements.

This perl library provides the ability to calculate the distance 
between two geographic points and to find the closest locations to 
a single point using a database connection.  There is both a 
function oriented interface, and an object oriented interface.  
Both have the same capabilities.  Your choice of interface depends 
on your programming style and needs.  Geo::Distance only recognizes 
standard decimal based longitude and latitude measurements.  If you 
have other coordinate systems that you would like to use, then take 
a peak at the Geo::Coordinates::* modules.  The distance that is 
returned can be in one of several different measurements, such as 
meters, light seconds, miles, inches, feet, etc.
